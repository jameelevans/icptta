    <h2 class="h2__header h2__header--grey about-us__heading">History</h2>
    <p class="about-us__history">In 2020, the Office for Victims of Crime, operating under the US Department of Justice, recognized a need to improve communitiesâ€™ capabilities to deal with increasing amounts of criminal mass violence and domestic terrorism (CMV/DT).</p>
    <p class="about-us__history">The needs that arise from CMV/DT are seen in victims, responders, and their impacted communities.</p>
    <p class="about-us__history">Victims struggle with many of the following:</p>
    <ul class="about-us__list">
      <li class="about-us__item">Emotional reactions that may remain for extended periods of time</li>
      <li class="about-us__item">Need for medical and rehabilitative care,</li>
      <li class="about-us__item">Need for financial support for health care and adaptive equipment </li>
      <li class="about-us__item">Loss of employment income</li>
      <li class="about-us__item mb-lg">Navigating regulations and forms for insurance claims, victim compensation, and unemployment.</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="about-us__history">Responders may also struggle with the following:</p>
    <ul class="about-us__list">
      <li class="about-us__item">Vicarious trauma </li>
      <li class="about-us__item">Behavioral health concerns, including increased substance use/abuse, depression, and anxiety</li>
      <li class="about-us__item">Increased responder suicides or domestic violence incidents</li>
    </ul>

    <p class="about-us__history">Communities grapple with the loss of community members and how to return to a sense of safety. </p>
    <p class="about-us__history">The Improving Community Preparedness to Assist Victims of Mass Violence and Domestic Terrorism: Training and Technical Assistance (ICP TTA) program was funded by the Office for Victims of Crime to address these concerns. Directed by ICF, in cooperation with four national partners and a cadre of subject matter experts, ICP TTA provides training and technical assistance using <a class="link" href="/resources">16 best practices</a> to close the gap between emergency management and victim services operations. </p>
